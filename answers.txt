Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?
Answer: Merging has the two individual version nodes (one of the master branch and one of the edited version) pointing into a new one while rebasing reconfigures its nodes in a line in which one node only has one input and output. 
Effectively they result in the same thing but rebasing results in a linear commit history often seen as cleaner.
